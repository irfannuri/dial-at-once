# dial-at-once

The useful iOS application that enables finding contacts by the help of numeric pad.
You can already find it in itunes : https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dialatonce/id894593835?l=tr&mt=8

Primary features are:

- Tap numbers on Numeric Pad to easily find contacts.
- Shows organization and phone numbers of contacts to help identification
- Supports all Latin characters (ES202130_111_LanguageIndependent_Latin)
- Optimized for dialing : Lists only contacts with phone numbers
- Direct Call Button for number entered is shown when filter exceeds 4 chars.

I have developed it almost 2 years ago after feeling enough frustration about iPhone's Contacts app which lacked the very basic feature that most Android have, using numpad to filter contacts.
I just put it in github making it the first of my open source work yet to come.
It has been developed using Xamarin on Mac, with contributions by Erdinc (@webtsrm on twitter) and Ali (http://codebuster.io).

It makes use of Xamarin Forms, multi-platform code development by making use of PCL and thus presenting samples of Inversion of control in Xamarin and SQLite usage.

I am going to put some implementation details here soon hopefully.

Here are some screenshots from the app:
